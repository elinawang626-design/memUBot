After calling this tool, you MUST write the service code to the returned servicePath.

The service code MUST follow this pattern:
1. Import http/https for making requests
2. Define the monitoring/task logic
3. When triggered, call the invoke API at MEMU_API_URL with context and data
4. The invoke API will evaluate and decide whether to notify the user

Environment variables available to the service:
- MEMU_SERVICE_ID: The service ID
- MEMU_API_URL: The local API URL (http://127.0.0.1:31415)`,

(including fetched data and local filter decisions), then exit.

Returns the captured stdout, stderr, and exit code. Use this to verify:
1. The service can successfully fetch data from external sources
2. The local filtering logic produces meaningful results
3. No runtime errors occur

If dry run fails or output is not meaningful, fix the service code and retry.
If after multiple attempts (max 3) it still fails, delete the service and report to user.`,
